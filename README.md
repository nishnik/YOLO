# YOLO
YOLO App for Soft Computing Course

In this application we propose a fuzzy logic method to provide a comprehensive study of how a person spends his/her day. In a smart city, it is assumed that a person will carry his/her cellular device to most of the places he/she visits. We use this fact and collect his/her location data from time and time and analyze his/her daily life according to the time spent by him at each place of interest.
